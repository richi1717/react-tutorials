<h2>React Tutorials</h2>
This is just a repo that I am putting up for all of my tutorials for React that I am doing.  Most of them are simple and easy to understand.  Not all of them are from tutorials but for simplicity, I am including them in here.  Once I am way more familar with React I will open up a new repo with my React apps.  I hope to get to the point where I can teach others how to use React in a way that will stick with them and make it fun.  I am thoroughly enjoying going through this and think that React is going to be a staple in my design portfolio.

<h2>NPM</h2>
If you clone this repo and want to mess with some of these tutorials as well, just open up the directory that you want to work in and use npm to install it.  A lot of people aren't aware of the shortcut for 'install' with npm but you can just use npm i and it is the same as saying npm install.

```$ npm i```
